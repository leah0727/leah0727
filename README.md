## 📊 Data Scientist | 🧠 Data-Driven Problem Solver with Statistical Insight | 💬 Persistent & Goal-Driven Team Player

## 🧠 About Me
- **📈 Solving Problems with Statistical Logic and Data Analysis**
With a humanities background, I’ve developed a strong ability to understand diverse perspectives and contexts. I apply this mindset to analyze data statistically, breaking down complex problems into clear, actionable insights.

- **📊 Hands-On Big Data Experience with Business Impact**
I engineered 68 features from 256K infertility patient records by carefully handling complex relationships and missing values. Our team built a 5-seed XGBoost ensemble that achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.7422. I contributed feature engineering and business insights that helped us place 3rd out of 798 teams ($5,200 prize) in LG Chem’s infertility treatment project.

- **🤝 Collaborative and Persistent**
I work well with teams from various backgrounds, combining persistence and a positive attitude to build trust and drive projects to successful outcomes.

- **🔍 Creating Value with a Broad and Practical Perspective**
I approach healthcare, insurance, and other industry challenges with a focus on explainability and reliability, delivering data-driven insights that create real impact for clients and organizations.
